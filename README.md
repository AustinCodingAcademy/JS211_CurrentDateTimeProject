# Austin Coding Academy

## JavaScript 211 Project: Current Date and Time

### Part 1

1. Navigate to `main.js`
1. Read the instructions and build the functions to satisfy the tasks.
1. There are no unit tests for this project.

### Part 2

1. Navigate to `index.html`
1. Notice the link to `main.js`
1. Display your results to the user in the DOM using `<button>` and `<input>`.

### Hints

1. Use [repl.it](https://www.repl.it) to write the solution code first. (it's a faster environment vs using the `node main.js` command over and over again.)
1. Download the Live Server package to VS Code by Ritwick Dey to view it at localhost:5500
1. **OR** use the `npm start` command to view it at localhost:8080
1. Use the [JS Docs at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toString)
1. **Clone, setup, testing, and running instructions for all projects is below**

******

## Cloning Your Project

1. Click the 'Fork' button (choose your account if prompted).
1. Copy HTTPS URL from your forked repository
1. In your terminal/gitBash/CommandPrompt navigate (using `cd`) into a directory where you want to start keeping your repositories. (`/jsDevFolder`)
1. Clone your new repository by typing `git clone <forked clone URL>` (the HTTPS
URL you copied above)
  ![Forking a repository](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tYsLHaLo8JRdp0xC1EZrAo0o9Wvv4S5AD937cokVOBk/pub?w=960&h=720)
1. Now go into the new directory by using `cd project-repo`

1. Add the base repository as an upstream
    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/<PROJECT-REPO>.git`

1. Check the configuration of your remotes with `git remote -v`, it should look
very similar to this (except it'll be YOUR username)

```bash
$ git remote -v

origin  git@github.com:username/javascript-workbook.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/javascript-workbook.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:AustinCodingAcademy/javascript-workbook.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:AustinCodingAcademy/javascript-workbook.git (push)
```

### Setup

1. From your project directory, run `npm i` to tell NPM to install all the
node modules we use in this class (see `package.json`)
1. Use your textEditor (VS Code) to change your files.
1. When you're finished `git status`, stage your file `git add .`, commit your changes `git commit -m "functions working"`, and push to
GitHub `git push`
    ```bash
    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```


1. Now go to your forked repository on GitHub (at
  https://github.com/your-username/javascript-workbook). A little yellow box
  should have popped up asking you to make a Pull Request. Click to review.

1. Click "Create Pull Request"

1. Every time you make a change *and push to GitHub*, this PR will automatically
update. No need to do it more than once.

#### Get latest workbook updates

1. To get the latest code/homework/test updates, be sure to have a "clean
working directory" by committing or removing all of your changes. You check for
a "clean working environment" by running `git status` and making sure no files
show up.

1. Run `git pull upstream gh-pages`

### Running the apps

Simply run `node path/to/file.js`

example `node 01week/rockPaperScissors.js`

### Running Tests

Tests are a great way to make sure your code works the way you planned it would,
and to make sure you don't break something in the future. We will be using them
to test our understanding of the lesson. It's also our main way to assign grades
for an assignment.

To run the tests on a file run `npm test path/to/file.js`, etc.

### Running the Linter

Simply run `npm run lint`

#### Running the Server

1. Run `npm start`
1. To break out of the server, press `ctrl` + `c`
